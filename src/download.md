Download
========

Versions
--------

The latest stable version is *{{latestTag}}*. Older versions are also [available via Github]({{repo}}/releases).

Node.js and Browserify
-------

Install [Oboe from NPM](http://www.npmjs.org/package/oboe):

``` bash
$ npm install oboe
```

Add `--save` if you want to keep Oboe as a dependency in your package.json file:

``` bash
$ npm install oboe --save
```

Once installed load as usual:

``` javascript
var oboe = require('oboe');
```

Downloading manually for the Browser
-----------------------------------

Save one of these files:
 
 * [oboe-browser.js]({{releasedJs}}/oboe-browser.js) for development 
 * [oboe-browser.min.js]({{releasedJs}}/oboe-browser.min.js) - minified for production. The size after gzip is 4.9k.
  
Using Bower package manager
-----------

You can fetch using [Bower](http://bower.io/) like this:

``` bash
$ bower install oboe
```

Using Jam package manager
---------

Oboe.js is also [available](http://jamjs.org/packages/#/details/oboe) through [Jam](http://jamjs.org/):

``` bash
$ jam install oboe
```

Loading using AMD
-----------------

If there is no AMD present, once the Oboe Javascript is loaded you can start 
using the global `oboe` object. However, when AMD is detected Oboe `defines` itself instead 
of adding itself as global variable.

When AMD is used Oboe can be accessed asynchronously using `require`:

``` javascript
require( ['oboe'], function( oboe ) {
   
});
```

If you know Oboe has already been loaded you can also access it synchronously although this
is usually not the best way:

``` javascript
var oboe = require('oboe');
```

Configuration for Require.js
------------------------

When using with Require.js some config is needed so Require knows to load a file
named `oboe-browser.js` for the `oboe` module. Alternatively, you could rename
`oboe-browser.js` to `oboe.js`.

``` javascript
require.config({
    paths: {
        oboe: 'oboe-browser'
    }
});
```

This is similar to the [config required to use jQuery with Require](http://requirejs.org/docs/jquery.html).

Polyfills
---------

If you need Oboe to work with older versions of Internet Explorer polyfils such as
[ES5-shim](http://github.com/es-shims/es5-shim) are required to bring the environment
up to ECMAScript 5.
